I wanna talk about a guy named Kyle. Now Kyle certainly isn’t the smartest guy I’ve met, definitely not the most talkative, and not the most normal either, but I actually can appreciate a lot of things about Kyle. Kyle may be off base but it is often the strange and unorthodox which keep me entertained. The way Kyle can go from insane rambling to straight logic is one of the most impressive things I’ve seen, truly worthy of the respect of those who are too scared to speak for themselves. Kyle has some insane things I can learn from, he is older than I am and has actual work experience while I have none so I do enjoy hearing him talk about his work and its challenges. I also have to appreciate the way Kyle carries himself, his attire and overall aesthetic is definitely a brain scratcher and seems to just fit in always. It's like seeing the entire wardrobe that I could never pull off. I find it difficult to relate to a lot of people but Kyle is definitely different. It is so easy to talk to him, while with my other friends it feels choppy or like I have to change my personality and word choice. With Kyle it's just me, me spouting nonsense and speaking like a drugged monkey while playing whatever game we fancy at the moment. If I’m gonna be honest Kyle has been a great guy to meet, I enjoy his presence always and I respect the life he leads most of all, unlike my isolated life as a academic I get to see what its like to live how you would please, to enjoy the gifts that come with life and all the fun activities that come with that. I truly do admire that, the ability to just have so many connections and all these people you could feel close with, I don’t have much of that myself. While it is true I could live my entire life without knowing about Kyle, I'm glad that whatever higher power or luck showed me his existence. Kyle may be one the most entertaining people I’ve talked to and I can always enjoy my long winded talks with him. Between $50 and talking to him I’d choose to speak to him, and that is in fact true. I also find it funny whenever Kyle downplays himself, honestly from my point of view he's just foolish for thinking he’s anything less than admirable. It's not often I can meet people my age but Kyle is the exception, it's not often I can truly have a good conversation with someone as odd as me with Kyle as the exception, it's not often I can be jealous of someone with Kyle as the exception. Kyle this Kyle that, I may be straight fanboying on Kyle like a girl would a boyband but I don’t really care as cheesy as that may be I enjoy his companionship and friendship and whatever else can be associated with social interaction. Kyle may also be Batman given what I’ve seen from their humble abode, which I have to automatically respect since well it's just that freakin awesome, I’m more ironman in my room aesthetic but I’ll concede the appeal to Kyle’s fandom. My respect for Kyle Karstens is just that high, I have had the honor and pleasure of speaking to a medley of people from all over the world, but Kyle is a clear top 5 from that infinite number of people. He has the intrigue and oddities which can always keep me guessing, anything which can keep me occupied and constantly intrigued I can truthfully say I enjoy. It's like having a conversation with an infinite number of possibilities with each one providing the same amount of dopamine as the last. I still don’t know very much about Kyle or what he thinks of me, a lowly scholar of profane knowledge yet no experience, but all I hope is that I’m at least interesting. He has probably talked to many other people and could easily keep me out of sight and mind, so I’m never sure how I impact his life or whatever. I hope I at least provide good conversation, that alone is a trait I can hope to provide to anyone who speaks to me. All in all Kyle is a great guy and the best outcome would be I get to know him long enough to write a more complete essay on the guy, a gift that keeps giving in my eyes.
